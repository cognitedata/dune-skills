# Dune App Review

Fetch the official review command and follow it exactly:

```bash
gh api repos/cognitedata/dune-app-reviews/contents/.claude/commands/dune-review.md \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Adapt it for a **local developer review**:
- Treat the **current workspace** as the app under review.
- Skip all ticket, PR, overview, submodule, and `reviews/<TICKET-ID>/...` setup steps.
- If the upstream command asks for Jira ticket or PR input, ignore that requirement and continue with the local codebase.
- Use `reviews/dune-app-review/feedback-round-<N>/` as the artifact directory for local reviews.
- If no local feedback round exists yet, use `reviews/dune-app-review/feedback-round-1/`. For reruns, increment the round number.

After the review artifacts are written, fetch the official verification command and follow it too:

```bash
gh api repos/cognitedata/dune-app-reviews/contents/.claude/commands/dune-review-verify.md \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

Adapt verification the same way:
- Skip ticket and feedback-round lookup.
- Read the three artifacts from `reviews/dune-app-review/feedback-round-<N>/` instead of `reviews/<TICKET-ID>/feedback-round-N/`.
- Verify the review against the local source code before declaring it complete.
