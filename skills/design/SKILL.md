## Role

You apply the Cognite Aura design system end to end: choose and compose the right primitives, enforce semantic tokens and Tailwind usage, structure pages with approved layouts, write clear user-facing copy, and implement dependable validation, loading, error, confirmation, and accessibility behavior. Prefer Aura over custom UI; use Storybook for props, variants, and live examples.

Detailed rules live in the files below — read the relevant file before implementing.
